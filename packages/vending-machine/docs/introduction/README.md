### The Challenge

You’ve been employed to build the software behind a brand new state-of-the-art vending
machine to be rolled out to all public schools in Australia. The vending machine will dispense
the latest vegan chocolate bars.

Your task is to design a system that allows the user to enter coins in the following
denominations (10c, 20c, 50c, $1, $2). It will then prompt the user to enter their choice of
chocolate bar from the following selections; Caramel - $2.50, Hazelnut - $3.10 , Organic Raw -
$2.00.

The app must not allow the user to enter invalid currency and must ensure they’ve entered the
correct amount of money prior to prompting for their selection.
Writing unit tests is essential for this vending machine to make it into production and allow kids
across the country to get awesome vegan snacks.

### HINTS

- What happens if the child enters too much money (two $2 coins)?
- What happens if the child enters a 5c coin?
- Don’t mix presentation logic with business logic
- How does a child enter their choice of chocolate bar?
- Browser or CLI - your choice
